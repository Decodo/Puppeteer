### Disclaimer

The following example is a simple script that shows how to use Decodo with Puppeteer.js.
We suggest researching [Puppeteer.js](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) documentation in order to continue development with this tool.

### Prerequisites

To run our example script, you are going to need a few libraries as well as Node.js.

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Puppeteer.js](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer)

### Installation

1. Once you have your project directory ready for development with Puppeteer.js, open it using Terminal/Command prompt utilising `cd` command.
2. After that, execute the following command to download our proxy setup example file:

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Decodo/Puppeteer/master/puppeteer.js > puppeteer.js`

3. You should see a new file named puppeteer.js in your project folder. Edit it using an editor of your choice.

4. To set up your username, password, and endpoint you would like to use, change the corresponding lines within punctuation marks ('').

### Usage

To run this example script, while in your project folder, run the following command:

`node puppeteer.js`

If you did everything correctly, you should see an IP appearing from our proxy server once the script finishes running.
